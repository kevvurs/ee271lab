Inexpensive: hubcap, candle, bedpan.
These items are junk, so Fred is willing to give a good deal for them. The candle is unscented, and the other two items are used.

Expensive: coffee, pop cd, phone.
These items cost more at Fred's store. The coffee is an organic, fair-trade, limited edition microblend. The CD and the phone are comparably more valuable than the other junk at this local business.
